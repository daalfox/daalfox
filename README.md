## Summary

Self thought developer. I enjoy implementing _domain specific logic_,
_APIs_ and _web interfaces_.
I try to learn a field, not a stack. Languages, frameworks and
libraries are only tools to achieve things.

## More about me

I enjoy trying cutting edge technologies and using new stacks. I enjoyed
