Rust developer for 3+ years of experience with contributions to `rodio`,
`jiff`, `tower-http` and other well known crates. I'm interested in distributed
systems, async world, networking and building scalable web services. TDD makes
me happy.

Areas of specialization:

- `tokio`, `axum`, `tower`, `sqlx` and building web services.
- `iroh`, networking, quic protocol and http/3
- `clap` and building command line interfaces
