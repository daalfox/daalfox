Rust developer for +3 years with contributions to `rodio`, `jiff`, `tower-http` and other well known crates. I'm interested in distributed systems, async world and building scalable services.

Highly familiar fields:
- `tokio`, `axum`, `tower`, `sqlx` and building web APIs.
- `clap` and building command line interfaces
